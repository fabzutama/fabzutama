## Hi there, I'm Fabian Zikri Utama 👋
## About Me
I’m currently on an exciting journey transitioning from the fast-paced world of Food & Beverage (F&B) into the dynamic field of Cybersecurity.For four years, I honed my skills in the F&B industry, learning valuable lessons in teamwork, attention to detail, and problem-solving in high-pressure environments. While I loved the fast pace and challenges, I’ve always had a passion for technology and security. Recognizing the increasing importance of cybersecurity in today’s digital age, I decided to make a career pivot to protect organizations from emerging threats.
## Why Cybersecurity?
The world is becoming more interconnected, and with that, the need for robust cybersecurity solutions has never been greater. My experience in F&B has taught me how crucial it is to ensure smooth operations and mitigate risks — skills I now apply to cybersecurity. I’m fascinated by ethical hacking, network security, and the ever-evolving threat landscape, and I am eager to contribute to securing digital infrastructures.
## Skills I'm Bringing to Cybersecurity
- Problem-Solving Under Pressure: Years in F&B taught me how to think critically and resolve issues swiftly — a mindset I now apply to security challenges.
- Attention to Detail: Ensuring nothing falls through the cracks is crucial in both industries, whether it's a customer order or network vulnerabilities.
- Teamwork: I understand the value of clear communication and collaboration, crucial for working in cybersecurity teams to secure systems and prevent breaches.
