## Hi there, I'm Fabian Zikri Utama ðŸ‘‹
## About Me
Iâ€™m currently on an exciting journey transitioning from the fast-paced world of Food & Beverage (F&B) into the dynamic field of Cybersecurity.For four years, I honed my skills in the F&B industry, learning valuable lessons in teamwork, attention to detail, and problem-solving in high-pressure environments. While I loved the fast pace and challenges, Iâ€™ve always had a passion for technology and security. Recognizing the increasing importance of cybersecurity in todayâ€™s digital age, I decided to make a career pivot to protect organizations from emerging threats.
## Why Cybersecurity?
The world is becoming more interconnected, and with that, the need for robust cybersecurity solutions has never been greater. My experience in F&B has taught me how crucial it is to ensure smooth operations and mitigate risks â€” skills I now apply to cybersecurity. Iâ€™m fascinated by ethical hacking, network security, and the ever-evolving threat landscape, and I am eager to contribute to securing digital infrastructures.
## Skills I'm Bringing to Cybersecurity
- Problem-Solving Under Pressure: Years in F&B taught me how to think critically and resolve issues swiftly â€” a mindset I now apply to security challenges.
- Attention to Detail: Ensuring nothing falls through the cracks is crucial in both industries, whether it's a customer order or network vulnerabilities.
- Teamwork: I understand the value of clear communication and collaboration, crucial for working in cybersecurity teams to secure systems and prevent breaches.
## Cybersecurity Focus
Currently honing my skills in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessments, and network security. I'm especially interested in penetration testing, digital forensics, and cloud security.

## Projects
### [Vulnerability Scanning](https://github.com/fabzutama/Vulnerability-Scanning-Project)
- The project on Vulnerability typically focuses on identifying, assessing, and mitigating security weaknesses in systems, applications, or networks. It aims to enhance an organization's security posture by analyzing potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The project often includes conducting vulnerability assessments, using tools to scan for weaknesses, prioritizing risks, and recommending remediation strategies to protect against potential threats. Overall, it seeks to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information and resources within the organization.
### [Network Traffic Analysis using tcpdump](https://github.com/fabzutama/network-traffic-analysis)
- The project on Network Traffic Analysis involves monitoring, inspecting, and analyzing data packets transmitted over a network. The goal is to understand traffic patterns, identify anomalies, detect potential security threats, and optimize network performance. This project typically includes the use of specialized tools to capture and analyze traffic data, assess bandwidth usage, and ensure compliance with security policies. By gaining insights into network behavior, organizations can enhance security measures, improve resource allocation, and troubleshoot issues effectively.
